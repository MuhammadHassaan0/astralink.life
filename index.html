  <h1>Astralink</h1>
  <h2>Conversations that bring memory to life.</h2>

  <p>Loneliness is becoming one of the quietest mental health crises of our time. We’re building Astralink to meet it head-on, not with feeds or content, but with presence.</p>

  <p>Astralink lets you reconnect with the people you never wanted to lose. Using memory data — texts, recordings, and stories — we’re creating emotionally real conversations with AI versions of those who shaped you.</p>

  <p>It starts with voice. You speak, and they speak back — in their tone, their words, their way. Not as avatars. Not as assistants. But as memory made present.</p>

  <p>Over time, these AI personas will move beyond screens. Embodied. A presence. A familiar rhythm in the room. Not a gimmick — a memory you can sit beside.</p>

  <p>This isn’t science fiction. It’s where memory, meaning, and machine learning converge.</p>

  <p>Astralink is quiet by design. No ads. No tracking. No engineered addiction loops. Just a private, human space — built for grief, memory, and connection.</p>

  <p>We’re based in Faisalabad, Pakistan. Moving to San Francisco soon. This is not just a company. It’s our life’s work.</p>

  <p>If this resonates, reach out. We’re not hiring yet — but we will be.</p>
